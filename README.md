# 2. What is the difference between null and undefined?
While both null and undefined represent "no value" in JavaScript, they are distinct in their roles and origins.

Origin and Context
null :usually denotes an intentionally absent value, and developers can set a variable to null to signify the absence of an object or a value. For example, if an API call doesn't return data, you might set a variable to null.

undefined: typically indicates a variable that has been declared but not yet been assigned a value, or a property that doesn't exist on an object.
